# Middlewares

There are some definitions of middlewares depending the kind of application you are creating. Eryn works with middlewares as the concept [defined by `Redux`](https://redux.js.org/understanding/history-and-design/middleware).

The only implemented middleware is a simple logger for Redux but middlewares can be much more. So, if you need Middlewares they can be placed at the `middlewares/` directory. And, if you are not using any middlewares, you can easily remove the middlewares directory.
