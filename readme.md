## Basic Usage

When starting your [React Native project](https://reactnative.dev/), use this project as template such as:

```sh
npx react-native MyApp --template react-native-template-eryn
```

Make sure you checked out about the [used libraries](https://caiangums.github.io/react-native-template-eryn/#/libs) and the [architectural choices](https://caiangums.github.io/react-native-template-eryn/#/usage)

## Goals

- _No usage of Expo CLI_
- Basic Configuration with common used libs
- Basic Architecture Structure
- Support extensions: libs, architectures or personal choices

# Supported and Implemented Libs

In general, people tend to use same libraries for doing the same job across projects. On intention of avoiding copy-and-paste code, those are the implemented and supported libs that I personally tend to use:

- [**Axios**](https://github.com/axios/axios) for requests
- [**Redux**](https://redux.js.org/) for Global State Management + [**Redux Thunk**](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) for async calls inside actions
- [**Eslint**](https://eslint.org/) for code maintance and general fixes + [_import resolver_](https://github.com/tleunen/babel-plugin-module-resolver) ([Babel](https://babeljs.io/)/Eslint)
- [**Prettier**](https://prettier.io/) basic support if wanted
- [**React Navigation**](https://reactnavigation.org/) for screens
- [**React Native Dotenv**](https://github.com/goatandsheep/react-native-dotenv) for Environment Variables
